## GIT Commit Count Decorator

To enable a decorator showing the number of commits on every file in go to "Preferences" -> "General" -> "Appearance" -> "Label Decorations" and check "GIT Commit count".

## Further ideas

 * The longer a file or directory wasn't commited the weaker it should appear (like in mylyn).
 * Slider for a timespan (e.g. 1 day ago, 1 week ago) where all files disappear that were not commited within that period disappear.
